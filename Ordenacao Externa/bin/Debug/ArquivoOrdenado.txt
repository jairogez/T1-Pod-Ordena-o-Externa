                                    CRATYLUS
                                    by Plato
                             -THE END-
                         translated by Benjamin Jowett
     Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal men.
     But now that fate has closed over this race
     For he alone defended their city and long walls?
     Illustrious Ajax, son of Telamon, lord of the people,
     Ocean, the origin of Gods, and mother Tethys.
     The Gods call Chalcis, and men Cymindis:
     The fair river of Ocean was the first to marry, and he espoused
     They are holy demons upon the earth,
     Whom the Gods call Xanthus, and men call Scamander.
     You appear to have spoken in all things much to my mind.
  Crat. But I suppose one of the two not to be names at all.
  Crat. But, Socrates, am I not right in thinking that he must
  Crat. Certainly not.
  Crat. Certainly they cannot.
  Crat. Certainly, Socrates, I think so.
  Crat. Certainly.
  Crat. Certainly.
  Crat. Certainly.
  Crat. Certainly.
  Crat. Certainly.
  Crat. Clearly, Socrates.
  Crat. Clearly.
  Crat. How so?
  Crat. How so?
  Crat. I agree.
  Crat. I agree; and think that what you say is very true.
  Crat. I am.
  Crat. I believe that to be both the only and the best sort of
  Crat. I believe, Socrates, the true account of the matter to be,
  Crat. I certainly believe that the methods of enquiry and
  Crat. I quite acknowledge, Socrates, what you say to be very
  Crat. I should reply that Hermogenes is not his name at all, but
  Crat. I should say not.
  Crat. I should say that he would be putting himself in motion to
  Crat. I should say that there were two Cratyluses.
  Crat. I should say that we must learn of the truth.
  Crat. I should say that you were right.
  Crat. I should.
  Crat. I should.
  Crat. I think that there is a good deal in what you say, Socrates.
  Crat. I will do as you say, though I can assure you, Socrates,
  Crat. I would fain agree with you, Socrates; and therefore I say,
  Crat. Impossible.
  Crat. In as far as they are like.
  Crat. In my opinion, Socrates, the speaker would only be talking
  Crat. Nay, surely there is a significance to both of us.
  Crat. Neither spoken nor said.
  Crat. No, indeed.
  Crat. No; not in that way, Socrates.
  Crat. No; that is not reasonable.
  Crat. No; there I do not agree with you.
  Crat. Only the first.
  Crat. Quite true.
  Crat. Quite true.
  Crat. Representation by likeness, Socrates, is infinitely better
  Crat. That is my view.
  Crat. That is precisely what I mean.
  Crat. That is true.
  Crat. That may be true, Socrates, in the case of pictures; they
  Crat. The legislators, of whom you spoke at first.
  Crat. The use of names, Socrates, as I should imagine, is to inform:
  Crat. There again you were right.
  Crat. There would be no use, Socrates, in my quarrelling with you,
  Crat. They are.
  Crat. They must have known, Socrates.
  Crat. True.
  Crat. True.
  Crat. True.
  Crat. Undoubtedly.
  Crat. Very good, Socrates; I hope, however, that you will continue
  Crat. Very true, Socrates; but the case of language, you see, is
  Crat. Very true.
  Crat. Very true.
  Crat. Very true.
  Crat. Well, but surely, Hermogenes, you do not suppose that you
  Crat. What do you mean?
  Crat. What you are saying is, I think, true.
  Crat. Why, Socrates, how can a man say that which is not?- say
  Crat. Why, perhaps the letter l is wrongly inserted, Socrates, and
  Crat. Yes, I do.
  Crat. Yes, I do.
  Crat. Yes, I remember.
  Crat. Yes, I see.
  Crat. Yes, Socrates, but observe; the greater number express motion.
  Crat. Yes, Socrates, what you say, as I am disposed to think, is
  Crat. Yes, if they are names at all.
  Crat. Yes, my dear friend, and the explanation of that is custom.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes.
  Crat. Yes; for the purpose of expressing motion.
  Crat. Yes; that is assuredly their meaning, and the true meaning.
  Crat. You are right, Socrates, in saying that I have made a study of
  Cratylus. If you please.
  For those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the
  Her. A name.
  Her. A real dithyrambic sort of name that, Socrates. But what do you
  Her. A shuttle.
  Her. An awl.
  Her. And what are the traditions?
  Her. And what do you say of their opposites?
  Her. And what is the true derivation?
  Her. And where does Homer say anything about names, and what does he
  Her. Assuredly they would.
  Her. Assuredly.
  Her. But how inconsistent should I be, if, whilst repudiating
  Her. But what do you say of Hephaestus?
  Her. But what do you say of kalon?
  Her. But what is selene (the moon)?
  Her. But what is the meaning of kakon, which has played so great a
  Her. But what shall we say of the next word?
  Her. But, Socrates, as I was telling you before, Cratylus
  Her. By all means.
  Her. Certainly not.
  Her. Certainly not.
  Her. Certainly we do.
  Her. Certainly, I care to know.
  Her. Certainly, Socrates.
  Her. Certainly, Socrates.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Certainly.
  Her. Clearly.
  Her. Clearly.
  Her. Clearly.
  Her. Desire, Socrates, is stronger far.
  Her. Exactly.
  Her. Fear not; I will do my best.
  Her. From these sort of Gods, by all means, Socrates. But why should
  Her. Good.
  Her. Good.
  Her. Hardly.
  Her. He cannot.
  Her. He would, according to my view.
  Her. How do you make that out?
  Her. How do you mean?
  Her. How do you mean?
  Her. How is that, Socrates?
  Her. How plausible?
  Her. How shall I reflect?
  Her. How so?
  Her. How so?
  Her. How so?
  Her. How so?
  Her. I agree.
  Her. I agree.
  Her. I assure you that I think otherwise, and I believe you to be on
  Her. I believe you are right.
  Her. I believe you to be in the right.
  Her. I cannot answer you, Socrates; but I find a difficulty in
  Her. I cannot say.
  Her. I do not know.
  Her. I do not see that we could do anything else.
  Her. I do not.
  Her. I do.
  Her. I have often talked over this matter, both with Cratylus and
  Her. I imagine, Socrates, that he must be the namer, or
  Her. I quite agree with you.
  Her. I remember.
  Her. I see.
  Her. I should explain to you, Socrates, that our friend Cratylus has
  Her. I should like very much to know, in the next place, how you
  Her. I should say that every part is true.
  Her. I should say that the natural way is the right way.
  Her. I should say the wise, of course.
  Her. I should say, he who is to use them, Socrates.
  Her. I should say, the men.
  Her. I should think so.
  Her. I think it very likely indeed.
  Her. I think so, Socrates.
  Her. I think so.
  Her. I think so.
  Her. I think that there is something in what you say, Socrates;
  Her. I think, Socrates, that we have said enough of this class of
  Her. I think, Socrates, that you are not improvising now; you must
  Her. I think, Socrates, that you are quite right, and I would like
  Her. I think, Socrates, that you have said the truth.
  Her. I very much approve.
  Her. I will take that which appears to me to follow next in order.
  Her. Impossible.
  Her. In my opinion, no. But I wish that you would tell me, Socrates,
  Her. Indeed I cannot.
  Her. Indeed I cannot.
  Her. Indeed, Socrates, you make surprising progress.
  Her. It must be so, I think.
  Her. It would.
  Her. Just that.
  Her. Let me hear, and I will do my best to assist you.
  Her. Let me hear.
  Her. Let me hear.
  Her. Let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous words.
  Her. May I ask you to examine another word about which I am curious?
  Her. Much less am I likely to be able.
  Her. Must not demons and heroes and men come next?
  Her. No, I cannot; and I would not try even if I could, because I
  Her. No, indeed, I never thought of it.
  Her. No, indeed.
  Her. No, indeed; but I have often had reason to think that there are
  Her. No, indeed; but, as Hesiod says, and I agree with him, "to
  Her. No, indeed; not I.
  Her. No; that is the smallest.
  Her. No; the parts are true as well as the whole.
  Her. Not many.
  Her. Of course.
  Her. Of course.
  Her. Of course.
  Her. Of what nature?
  Her. Only one more God! I should like to know about Hermes, of
  Her. Only the skilled.
  Her. Precisely.
  Her. Quite so.
  Her. Quite true.
  Her. Quite true.
  Her. Quite true.
  Her. So we must infer.
  Her. Still there remains Athene, whom you, Socrates, as an Athenian,
  Her. Such is my desire.
  Her. Such is my view.
  Her. Surely, we must not leave off until we find out their meaning.
  Her. Surely.
  Her. Surely.
  Her. That is a very shabby etymology.
  Her. That is another and certainly a most difficult question.
  Her. That is clear.
  Her. That is evident.
  Her. That is evident.
  Her. That is evident.
  Her. That is my notion.
  Her. That is probable.
  Her. That is quite true, Socrates.
  Her. That is quite true.
  Her. That is surely probable.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is true.
  Her. That is very likely, Socrates.
  Her. That is very probable, until some more probable notion gets
  Her. That may be inferred.
  Her. That must be a strange name, and I should like to hear the
  Her. That of the carpenter.
  Her. That of the smith.
  Her. That, Socrates, I can quite believe.
  Her. The idea is ingenious, Socrates.
  Her. The pilot.
  Her. The player of the lyre.
  Her. The skilled only.
  Her. The skilled only.
  Her. Then I am very sure that Cratylus was quite right in saying
  Her. Then I rather think that I am of one mind with you; but what is
  Her. There again I am puzzled.
  Her. There are the words which are connected with agathon and kalon,
  Her. There are.
  Her. There cannot.
  Her. There have been times, Socrates, when I have been driven in
  Her. There is a deal of truth in what you say.
  Her. There must be others.
  Her. There would be no choice, Socrates.
  Her. They did so.
  Her. To be sure I have, and what you say is true.
  Her. To be sure.
  Her. To be sure.
  Her. To be sure.
  Her. To be sure.
  Her. To the latter, I should imagine.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. True.
  Her. Very good.
  Her. Very good.
  Her. Very good.
  Her. Very good; and what do we say of Demeter, and Here, and Apollo,
  Her. Very likely you are right; but suppose that we leave these
  Her. Very likely.
  Her. Very likely.
  Her. Very likely.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true.
  Her. Very true; but what is the derivation of zemiodes?
  Her. Well, and what of them?
  Her. Well, but what is lusiteloun (profitable)?
  Her. Well, then, let me ask about the greatest and noblest, such
  Her. Well.
  Her. What device?
  Her. What do you mean?
  Her. What do you mean?
  Her. What do you mean?
  Her. What do you mean?
  Her. What do you mean?
  Her. What do you say of edone (pleasure), lupe (pain), epithumia
  Her. What do you say of pur (fire) and udor (water)?
  Her. What do you think of doxa (opinion), and that class of words?
  Her. What is Ares?
  Her. What is it?
  Her. What is the inference?
  Her. What is the inference?
  Her. What is the meaning of Dionysus and Aphrodite?
  Her. What of that?
  Her. What other appellation?
  Her. What then?
  Her. What was the name?
  Her. What way?
  Her. Which are they?
  Her. Why do you say so?
  Her. Why not?
  Her. Why, Socrates?
  Her. Why, how is that?
  Her. Why, of course they call them rightly, if they call them at
  Her. With all my heart; for am very curious to hear the rest of
  Her. Yes, I agree.
  Her. Yes, I do.
  Her. Yes, I suppose so.
  Her. Yes, Socrates, I can conceive no correctness of names other
  Her. Yes, Socrates; that is quite plain.
  Her. Yes, certainly.
  Her. Yes, that will be very proper.
  Her. Yes, that will be well.
  Her. Yes, the actions are real as well as the things.
  Her. Yes, they are wise.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.

  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes.
  Her. Yes; I do.
  Her. Yes; but what do you say of the other name?
  Her. Yes; that would be his name.
  Her. Yes; what other answer is possible?
  Her. Yes;- meaning the same as zetein (to enquire).
  Her. You are quickening your pace now, Socrates.
  Her. You bring out curious results, Socrates, in the use of names;
  Her. You have hammered away at them manfully; but suppose that
  Her. You seem to me, Socrates, to be quite like a prophet newly
  Her. You will oblige me.
  Hermogenes. Suppose that we make Socrates a party to the argument?
  PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES, HERMOGENES, CRATYLUS
  SOC. And whatever shuttles are wanted, for the manufacture of
  Soc. A very simple matter. I may illustrate my meaning by the
  Soc. Again, Hermogenes, there is Orestes (the man of the
  Soc. Again, cherdaleon (gainful) is called from cherdos (gain),
  Soc. Again, in burning, not every way is the right way; but the
  Soc. Again, is there not an essence of each thing, just as there
  Soc. All of them sprang either from the love of a God for a mortal
  Soc. All the names that we have been explaining were intended to
  Soc. And Homer, as you know, says that the Trojan men called him
  Soc. And I ask again, "What do we do when we weave?"- The answer is,
  Soc. And a true proposition says that which is, and a false
  Soc. And among legislators, there are some who do their work
  Soc. And are both modes of assigning them right, or only the first?
  Soc. And are not the good wise?
  Soc. And are not the works of intelligence and mind worthy of
  Soc. And are the men or the women of a city, taken as a class, the
  Soc. And as she has a light which is always old and always new (enon
  Soc. And at what point ought he to lose heart and give up the
  Soc. And can we rightly speak of a beauty which is always passing
  Soc. And conversely you may attribute the likeness of the man to the
  Soc. And do you know that the ancients said dougon and not zugon?
  Soc. And do you not believe with Anaxagoras, that mind or soul is
  Soc. And do you not suppose that good men of our own day would by
  Soc. And do you not think that many a one would escape from Hades,
  Soc. And does this art grow up among men like other arts? Let me
  Soc. And further, primitive nouns may be compared to pictures, and
  Soc. And he who gives all gives a perfect picture or figure; and
  Soc. And him who knows how to ask and answer you would call a
  Soc. And his father's name is also according to nature.
  Soc. And how does the legislator make names? and to what does he
  Soc. And how to answer them?
  Soc. And how to put into wood forms of shuttles adapted by nature to
  Soc. And if a man were to call him Hermogenes, would he not be
  Soc. And if by the greatest of chains, then by some desire, as I
  Soc. And if his conception was erroneous, and he gave names
  Soc. And if speaking is a sort of action and has a relation to acts,
  Soc. And if when I speak you know my meaning, there is an indication
  Soc. And if, on the other hand, wisdom and folly are really
  Soc. And is any desire stronger than the thought that you will be
  Soc. And is every man a carpenter, or the skilled only?
  Soc. And is every man a legislator, or the skilled only?
  Soc. And is every man a smith, or only the skilled?
  Soc. And is not Apollo the purifier, and the washer, and the
  Soc. And is not naming a part of speaking? for in giving names men
  Soc. And is not that the reason, Hermogenes, why no one, who has
  Soc. And is not the part of a falsehood also a falsehood?
  Soc. And may I not go to him again, and say, "This is your name"?-
  Soc. And may not a similar description be given of an awl, and of
  Soc. And may not the same be said of a king? a king will often be
  Soc. And mine, too, Hermogenes. But do not be too much of a
  Soc. And must not Homer have imagined the Trojans to be wiser than
  Soc. And must not this be the mind of Gods, or of men, or of both?
  Soc. And naming is an art, and has artificers?
  Soc. And not the rest?
  Soc. And now suppose that I ask a similar question about names: will
  Soc. And now, by the Gods, let us have no more of the Gods, for I am
  Soc. And speech is a kind of action?
  Soc. And suppose the names about which you are now asking should
  Soc. And suppose the shuttle to be broken in making, will he make
  Soc. And that l was expressive of smoothness, and softness, and
  Soc. And that principle we affirm to be mind?
  Soc. And that this is true of the primary quite as much as of the
  Soc. And that which has to be named has to be named with something?
  Soc. And that which has to be woven or pierced has to be woven or
  Soc. And the legislator, whether he be Hellene or barbarian, is
  Soc. And the name of anything is that which any one affirms to be
  Soc. And the principle of beauty does the works of beauty?
  Soc. And the proper letters are those which are like the things?
  Soc. And the same holds of other instruments: when a man has
  Soc. And the shuttle is the instrument of the weaver?
  Soc. And the work of the legislator is to give names, and the
  Soc. And there are many desires?
  Soc. And there are true and false propositions?
  Soc. And therefore I have the most entire conviction that he
  Soc. And therefore by the greatest desire, if the chain is to be the
  Soc. And this artist of names is called the legislator?
  Soc. And this holds good of all actions?
  Soc. And this is he who knows how to ask questions?
  Soc. And we cannot be wrong in supposing that this is derived from
  Soc. And we saw that actions were not relative to ourselves, but had
  Soc. And what do you say of the insertion of the l? for that is
  Soc. And what is custom but convention? I utter a sound which I
  Soc. And what is the nature of this truth or correctness of names?
  Soc. And what is the reason of this? Let us consider:- does he not
  Soc. And what of those who follow out of the course of nature, and
  Soc. And when the piercer uses the awl, whose work will he be
  Soc. And when the teacher uses the name, whose work will he be
  Soc. And when the weaver uses the shuttle, whose work will he be
  Soc. And when we want to express ourselves, either with the voice,
  Soc. And which, then, did he make, my good friend; those which are
  Soc. And who are they?
  Soc. And who is he?
  Soc. And who uses the work of the lyremaker? Will not he be the
  Soc. And who will be best able to direct the legislator in his work,
  Soc. And who will direct the shipwright?
  Soc. And will a man speak correctly who speaks as he pleases? Will
  Soc. And will there be so many names of each thing as everybody says
  Soc. And with which we name?
  Soc. And with which we weave?
  Soc. And would you further acknowledge that the name is an imitation
  Soc. And would you hold that the very good were the very wise, and
  Soc. And would you say that the giver of the first names had also
  Soc. And yet, as you are aware, that which is called by us
  Soc. And yet, if you are permitted to put in and pull out any
  Soc. And you would say that pictures are also imitations of
  Soc. And zugon (yoke) has no meaning,- it ought to be duogon,
  Soc. Any violent interpretations of the words should be avoided; for
  Soc. Are they altogether alike?
  Soc. Are you maintaining that falsehood is impossible? For if this
  Soc. Ares may be called, if you will, from his manhood (arren) and
  Soc. Athene?
  Soc. Because if we have we shall be obliged to admit that the people
  Soc. Because, according to the tradition, he had no forethought or
  Soc. But I doubt whether your view is altogether correct, Cratylus.
  Soc. But again, that which has to be cut has to be cut with
  Soc. But am not yet at my utmost speed.
  Soc. But are the letters r and s, equivalents; and is there the same
  Soc. But are these the only primary names, or are there others?
  Soc. But do you believe that in the discovery of them, he who
  Soc. But do you not allow that some nouns are primitive, and some
  Soc. But how about truth, then? you would acknowledge that there
  Soc. But how could he have learned or discovered things from names
  Soc. But how would you expect to know them? What other way can there
  Soc. But if Protagoras is right, and the truth is that things are as
  Soc. But if neither is right, and things are not relative to
  Soc. But if that is true, Cratylus, then I suppose that things may
  Soc. But if things are only to be known through names, how can we
  Soc. But if this is a battle of names, some of them asserting that
  Soc. But is a proposition true as a whole only, and are the parts
  Soc. But let us consider what is the nature of this information
  Soc. But let us see, Cratylus, whether we cannot find a
  Soc. But now the name is so travestied that you cannot tell the
  Soc. But tell me, friend, did not Homer himself also give Hector his
  Soc. But that, friend Cratylus, is no answer. For if he did begin in
  Soc. But the art of naming appears not to be concerned with
  Soc. But the name, in my opinion, is really most expressive of the
  Soc. But the secondary, as I conceive, derive their significance
  Soc. But then how ridiculous would be the effect of names on things,
  Soc. But who then is to determine whether the proper form is given
  Soc. But would you say, Hermogenes, that the things differ as the
  Soc. By the dog of Egypt I have not a bad notion which came into
  Soc. Cannot you at least say who gives us the names which we use?
  Soc. Certainly not. But let us have done with this question and
  Soc. Certainly.
  Soc. Demeter is e didousa meter, who gives food like a mother;
  Soc. Demons! And what do you consider to be the meaning of this
  Soc. Do we not give information to one another, and distinguish
  Soc. Do you admit a name to be the representation of a thing?
  Soc. Do you not know that the heroes are demigods?
  Soc. Do you not know what he says about the river in Troy who had
  Soc. Do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race of men
  Soc. Do you observe that only the ancient form shows the intention
  Soc. Does not the law seem to you to give us them?
  Soc. Does what I am saying apply only to the things themselves, or
  Soc. Doxa is either derived from dioxis (pursuit), and expresses the
  Soc. Enough then of names which are rightly given. And in names
  Soc. Ephaistos is Phaistos, and has added the e by attraction;
  Soc. Excellent Cratylus, I have long been wondering at my own
  Soc. First look at the matter thus: you may attribute the likeness
  Soc. For example, in very ancient times they called the day either
  Soc. For the several forms of shuttles naturally answer to the
  Soc. Good. But still the word is intelligible to both of us; when
  Soc. Good; and when the general character is preserved, even if some
  Soc. He often speaks of them; notably and nobly in the places
  Soc. He says of them-
  Soc. He should not be called Theophilus (beloved of God) or
  Soc. Heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in motion
  Soc. How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I
  Soc. How would you answer, if you were asked whether the wise or the
  Soc. How would you have me begin? Shall I take first of all him whom
  Soc. I am at a loss how to explain pur; either the muse of Euthyphro
  Soc. I am by no means positive, Cratylus, in the view which
  Soc. I am not likely to forget them.
  Soc. I am run away with.
  Soc. I believe that what you say may be true about numbers, which
  Soc. I believe you may be right, but I do not rightly understand
  Soc. I dare say that you be right, Hermogenes: let us see;- Your
  Soc. I do not think, Hermogenes, that there is any great
  Soc. I fancy to myself Heracleitus repeating wise traditions of
  Soc. I mean to say that the word "man" implies that other animals
  Soc. I should imagine that the name Hermes has to do with speech,
  Soc. I suppose you mean to say, Cratylus, that as the name is, so
  Soc. I suppose, Hermogenes, that people do not mean by the
